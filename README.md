# UV
Ultra Violet Sensor

This is an arduino project, which uses the RedBearLab nrf51822 board. A simple program which reads data from Adafruits UV SI1145 sensor board. This data can then be accessed over BLE using GATT characteristics using a Nordic nrf51822 module.

i Sensor I2 SI1145 Board

The source code is used as a library in this application.

ii Sensor Data

Ultra violet
Infra red
Visible Light

iii Nordic nrf51822 module

Three read/notification GATT characteristics allowing access to sensor data.

iv Sample

Current update time of sensor data is 1 second.
